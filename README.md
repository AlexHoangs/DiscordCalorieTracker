# DiscordCalorieTracker

Friend was in need of a way to track calories using applications that were most convenient for him. As a user who sepnds a lot of time on discord, I made him a bot to track his calories for him to help him reach his calorie goal. <br />

Personalized calorie tracker.<br />
• Prompts user 3 times a day to enter meal description and calorie count.<br />
• Allows user to input extra calories through commands to include mid-day snacks.<br />
• Sends a final message at night to notify user whether or not calorie goal was met or not.<br />
